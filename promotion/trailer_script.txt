From Below Pocket Trailer Outline:

======================================

"" = on screen text
[] = description of footage
<<>> = additional notes from me to you

======================================

<<for the first section, I think some subtle background sound, giving an "ominous" vibe>>

"From the ocean depths..."
[zoomed in footage panning across the ocean at the bottom the screen]
[01_KrakenGameplay_Basic_DMG]

"The Kraken has come!"
[camera shake as the Kraken's eyes go wide, and a "monster scream" sound plays]
[01_KrakenGameplay_Basic_DMG]

<<Trailer music kicks in here. I will provide the music, as it is from the game.>>
<<Music: Title.wav has a natural loop of 45s>>

"FROM BELOW POCKET"
"A New Game for you Game Boy!"
[logo reveal]

"Send blocks down at the monster to defend your castle"
[footage of basic kraken gameplay, zoomed slightly and panning]
[02_KrakenGameplayNearTop_Basic_GBC]

"As lines are cleared, the Kraken retreats"
[clear a line, Kraken withdrawls tentacle, zoomed in to show tentacle getting hit, and Kraken playing "exlamation" reaction]
[02_KrakenGameplayNearTop_Basic_GBC]

"Can you survive the night, and live to fight another day?"
[getting close to the top, pan up from tentacle pushing blocks]
[02_KrakenGameplayNearTop_Basic_GBC]

<<This section should be quick barage of features. Could be back to back quick cuts, or multiple videos overlapping with text popping in.>>

"Modern gameplay on the classic system"

"Full 10x20 game area"
[a grid animates in overtop of gameplay footage, showing that the gameplay area (where the blocks fall) is 10 tiles wide and 20 tiles high (with each tile being 8x7 pixels)]
[highlight to top 2 row, as that is the part that other similar games are missing (most games are only 10x18]

[03_WallKick_Basic_DMG]

<<I want this to feel like a big moment, and highlight of the trailer>>

"And exclusive to the Game Boy, Two-Player simultaneous play!"
[Footage of IRL players transitions into crisp, emulator footage of multiplayer game]
[First show IRL_01-08... in a quick montage (maybe split screen) showing the set up for a multiplayer game in real life]

[As last show is played (IRL_08_HeadToHead), zoom transition to footage taken direct from PC (
[Gameplay should be a quick montage showing the match advance from the main menu, cutting to mid game, and then the final few moments ending in "game over"]
[11_2PlayerMatch_Basic_DMG+GBC]

<<Originally I was imagining that this would have a "mock" set of Game Boys connected together by link cable, and showing the gameplay footage on the screens. I think this is probably the biggest ask of the project, so let me know what you think.>>

--

"Compatible with all Game Boy models, and enhanced for the Super Game Boy!"
[General footage of all platforms, I am imagining sliding in one after another, resulting in a 3 running clips side by side, with logos for each platform below the footage.]
[01_KrakenGameplay_Basic_DMG/GBC/SGB]

--

<<Trailer should have a very short "fake out" ending, probably a short black fade, before coming in with a "one more thing" moment>>

"You've been asking, and it's finally happening..."

"The return of From Below for the NES in physical form!"
[high level NES footage]
[99_TommyNTG_Save_NES - last little bit of the footage showing him getting out of death, and landing a 4 line clear]
